We used a Tuscan Gold (model: TG-003) NiCd,NiMH battery charger to charge the 'GP Battery (17AAAH, 1.2V, 170mAh, NiMH)'(in 2S configuration). Rated current capacity of the charger for the AAA size batteries (2S) is 100mA which is NOT the recommended amount of current for the mentioned tiny batteries. For the NiMH battery it is recommemnded to charge at 0.1C or below (0.05C usually) but very low current through the batteries will result in a long charge duration.
To overcome this problem we added a 147ohm resistor is series with the charger terminals and achieved a current flow of around 12mA (~0.07C). Another problem with these tiny batteries is that they can not be installed in the given slots. So a pair of Molex connectors were added to the charger with the wires soldered internally to the terminals (for 2S; 147ohm resistor added inside the charger).
